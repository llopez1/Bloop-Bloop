            There are aproximately two thousand bats on the roof, 
            and a racoon in the toilet. DO NOT GO HERE!!</p></li>
          <li id="toilet3">Wells Fargo Restroom
            <p id="showthis3" class="hide">Dude, this restroom is the best one I have seen so far. 
            It's got a warmed up toilet set, and a robot that actually help you wipe your ass. 
            Like, this thing is too real. It has a washing station with full stock amenities, 
            which include: ProActive, mints, and lemon scented soap.</p></li>
          <li id="toilet4">Public School Restroom
            <p id="showthis4" class="hide">This is a meh restroom.</p></li>
          <li id="toilet5">Bank of America Restroom
            <p id="showthis5" class="hide">You can get los in this restroom. 
            It's really like a maze. It took me two hours to find the exit of the restroom.</p></li>
